    <h1>POLTICS</h1>
    <p>
        Politics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings
        that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as “the art or science of
        government” and "political principles"), but it can and often does carry a
        negative meaning closely related to these (“political activities
        characterized by artful and often dishonest practices”).

    <!-- <p>The negative sense of politics, as seen in the phrase play politics, for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: “We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.”</p>
